	 				<span class="bold">Fábrica de Pastel</span> (Pastry Factory) is a short looping video that was projected on screens all around Lisbon and Porto. The prompt was to highlight the new MOP displays installed in both cities.<br><br>Our solution was to create an optical illusion of a room just behind the screen to showcase the potential worlds that can be created with it. The animation features a surrealist Rube-Goldberg-inspired "pastel de nata" factory, the famous Portuguese pastry.<br><br>This was a team project executed in Lisbon with credits going to: Diana Rit, Lucca Cunha, Beatriz Ruette.

	 				<span class="bold">The machines' designs</span> were inspired by the colorful vintage appliances of the 1960's. They embody a take on retrofuturism with a whimsicality akin to children's toys. The first machine's purpose was to create the dough. After many sketches, the final idea was to bring the dough through a glass tube to magically shape and eject it as a perfect cup.
